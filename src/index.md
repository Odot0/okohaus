[Ökohaus](/about) is an experimental school looking to help translate climate research into action. We are starting as a community and looking at ways to support community projects in the near future.

Some of our past work has included [building a bamboo bike studio](/), [reshaping our relationship with public utilities](https://ohdotzero.glitch.me), [building a community of independent creators](https://tinyfactories.space), [cataloging earth-friendly building materials](https://madewithnature.glitch.me), and [tracking methods of sequestering carbon](https://carbonbase.io). All as part of our goal to deploy [sustainabuility as a service](https://sustainability-as-a-service.glitch.me).

We encourage you to engage with us at your own pace:
